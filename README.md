# 👋 Hi, I'm Laura Squire

Welcome to my AI portfolio space! I'm a senior software engineer with a passion for agentic AI systems, LLM tooling, and GenAI applications that solve real-world problems.

After years in tech and a creative chapter running my own photography business, I'm now focused full-time on advancing my skills in large language models, RAG architectures, agent frameworks, and NVIDIA's GenAI stack.

---

## 🧠 Current Focus
- Building end-to-end GenAI applications using LangChain, AutoGen, and LangGraph
- Deploying LLMs using vLLM, Triton, and NeMo
- Experimenting with observability tools like LangSmith, Arize Phoenix, and W&B Weave
- Prototyping agent toolkits for enterprise workflows

---

## 🚧 Projects (in progress)
- **RAG Chatbot from Scratch** – Document Q&A with evaluation via RAGAs
- **Multi-Tool LLM Agent** – LangChain + LangGraph powered workflow for decision making
- **OpenAI + FastAPI Backend** – Serving LLMs through clean API endpoints with observability
- **AutoGen Agents** – Exploring multi-agent collaboration using Microsoft's AutoGen framework
